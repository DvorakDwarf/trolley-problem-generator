# trolley-problem-generator
This script just creates a set number of trolley problems. This is in no way shape or form optimized or clean. This was created for the sole purpose of making up data for another project. Use it at your own risk. Do whatever you want with the code

You can edit values in the script directly to customize what sorts of problems you want, however, if you just want a set number of problems you can run this script from the console like this:
```
python TrolleyProblemGenerator.py [number of samples]
```
This creates a .csv file in the same folder you had the script in. This file can be opened in google sheets, notepad, whatever can read .csv.
