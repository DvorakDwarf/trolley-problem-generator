# trolley-problem-generator
This script generates X number of trolley problems. I created this to make up a lot of data for my machine learning project. This is in no way shape or form optimized or clean. Use it at your own risk. Do whatever you want with the code, but credit would be nice if you did not change it much and are using it in something else.

You can edit values in the script directly to customize what sorts of problems you want, however, if you just want a set number of problems you can run this script from the console like this:
```
python TrolleyProblemGenerator.py [number of samples]
```
This creates a .csv file in the same folder you had the script in. This file can be opened in google sheets, notepad, whatever can read .csv
